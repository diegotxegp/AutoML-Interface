## Text with information about the tool
training_process_info_text = """
You have just chosen to train a model. Follow the next tabs to continue with the process of training.

1- Create a new project to allocate all the models in there. Else, select one already created.
2- Add a dataset to train. One copy of this will be saved in the project directory.
3- A series of questions will be asked to understand what you want to do.
4- Train. Brush up the summary of the previous data and push "Train".
5- After training, some graphics will be showed to check its performance.

Along this process, you can always check this information to make sure your steps.
